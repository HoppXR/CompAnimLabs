1.a) The motion will be slow at the start, middle, and speed up a lot at the end

  b) The motion will be slow at start, speed up near the middle, and slow down at the end 

  c) The motion will be very linear with a constant velocity from point a to b


2) When the animations are overlapped by 15 frames, the motions of the object will transition smoother and earlier to each animation.
